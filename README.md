# Spring Framework 5: Beginner to Guru

This repository is for an example application built in my [Spring Framework 5 - Beginner to Guru](https://www.udemy.com/testing-spring-boot-beginner-to-guru/?couponCode=GITHUB_REPO) online course

The application is a simple Spring Boot 2 / Spring Framework 5 web application. It is used to help students learn how
to use the Spring Framework. Step by step instructions and detailed explanations can be found within the course.
